- If something has a monthly (or other consistent) small date spread and a big date spread between 55 and 75, check to see if it is normally a monthly event with a weird outlier or two

- For stuff with a date spread < 30 with 2+ events per month, check to see if it is something that happens more frequently

- Between 160 and 200, check for something that happens twice a year (Insurance)

- Between 340 and 380, check for something that happens once a year (Annual Fee, Amazon Prime, etc)

- Look into groups things together (Work lunch, Gas, etc.)
    - But keep stuff like eating out for dinner each month separate

- Try to group together liquor stores by looking for liquor in the description/terminal name?
    - Allow to setup group name, keyword search, exceptions that should be added?

- Seasonal Groups? (Twins parking)

- Grocery/Home (Look for stuff that stays in the same general price range [something like under $200ish dollars?] and then catch outliers as their indv. purchases)




Notes for creating recurring event list
=======================================
- Create distribution hash (events with the same name within $5 or 5% of each other)

- Find the average date spread for a distribution
    - Sort a distribution by date
    - Grab the most recent 6 (or 7?) events
    - Remove 1 or 2 outliers

- See if the average date spread cleanly matches the transaction dates
    - Outliers amount allowed -- outliers <= ((dates.size - 4)/3 + 1)
    - Currently average spread needs to be between 14 and 380 days for a recurring event to be considered

- Once a recurring transaction has been found, save the data for reference later
    - is it current?
    - is it monthly?
    - if not, how often does it happen?
    - name?
    - amount?
    - is it income?
    - list of transactions
    - start date
    - end date
